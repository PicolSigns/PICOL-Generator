Before install, please make sure that scrips will running.
Load "check.php" file and test it. In case it fails, follow related links for installing and configuring the required classes.

FIRST STEP
Upload all "PICOL-Generator-master" directory content in the root of your site.


NEXT STEP
You have 2 methods to get the generator:
1. Just launch all pack with "index.php"
2. Integrate the application in your site.


1. LAUNCH ALL PACK
A simple solution is with iframe:
<iframe src="http://www.yoursite.com/PICOL-Generator-master/" width="100%" height="546" style="border: 0px none;"></iframe>

2. INTEGRATE IN YOUR SYSTEM
The Interface script creates also the temporary path for the zip files: launch it from root, otherwise will generate error.


First you need to add jQuery and AnythingSlider plugin in the HEAD tag.

<script type="text/javascript" src="PICOL-Generator-master/common/js/jquery/jquery-1.4.4.min.js"></script>
<!-- jquery AnythingSlider -->
<link type="text/css" href="PICOL-Generator-master/common/css/picol_anythingslider.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="PICOL-Generator-master/common/js/jquery/AnythingSlider/js/jquery.anythingslider.js"></script>

Then, insert this code in your section:
<?php require_once("common/tpl/generator_interface.tpl"); ?>
